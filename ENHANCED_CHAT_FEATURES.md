## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend (JavaScript)

const REACTIONS = ['❤️', '😂', '😢', '😡', '😮', '👍'];  // Available reactions
```

#### Main Functions

- `showReactionPicker(messageId)` - Displays reaction options
- `addReaction(messageId, emoji)` - Sends reaction via WebSocket
- `removeReaction(messageId, emoji)` - Removes user's reaction
- `showReactionUsers(messageId, emoji)` - Shows who reacted
- `handleReactionUpdate(update)` - Processes incoming reaction updates

**Replies:**
- `replyToMessage(messageId, senderName, content)` - Activates reply mode
- `cancelReply()` - Deactivates reply mode
- `scrollToMessage(messageId)` - Navigates to referenced message

**Delete:**
- `deleteMessage(messageId)` - Soft delete message
- `permanentlyDeleteMessage(messageId)` - Hard delete message
- `handleDeleteUpdate(update)` - Processes incoming delete updates

### Message Structure

#### Enhanced Message Object
```javascript
{
    id: "message-uuid",
    senderId: "user-id",
    senderName: "User Name",
    senderRole: "CUSTOMER" | "SELLER",
    content: "Message text",
    messageType: "TEXT" | "IMAGE" | "FILE",
    timestamp: "2025-11-01T10:30:00",
    
    // Reply fields
    replyToMessageId: "original-message-id",
    replyToSenderName: "Original Sender",
    replyToContent: "Original message preview",
    
    // Reactions
    reactions: {
        "❤️": ["user-id-1", "user-id-2"],
        "😂": ["user-id-3"]
    },
    
    // Delete status
    deleted: false
}
```

### WebSocket Topics

#### Subscriptions
```javascript
// Message updates
/topic/conversation/{conversationId}

// Reaction updates
/topic/conversation/{conversationId}/reactions

// Delete updates
/topic/conversation/{conversationId}/deletes
```

#### Endpoints
```javascript
// Send message (with optional reply fields)
/app/chat.sendMessage

// Add reaction
/app/chat.addReaction

// Remove reaction
/app/chat.removeReaction

// Soft delete
/app/chat.deleteMessage

// Permanent delete

```
